# DynamicEMF

This small library is designed to help you quickly prototype EMF applications
using EMF dynamic instances. This library provides wrappers around EMF basic
concepts.

## EMF dynamic instances

EMF is a powerful framework for metamodels/models handling. It provides a many
facilities to create/build applications using metamodels and models. A strong
feature of EMF is this ability to deal with dynamic instances, _i.e._ manipulating
model instances without generating the Java code derived from a metamodel. Using
dynamic instances, you can quickly messing around with models and prototyping
stuffs before going to the EMF metamodel code generation process.

Unfortunately, this feature require advanced skills to deal with. Moreover,
for the new user, the ResourceSet/Resource layer along with the metamodel
registering/generation, Eclipse plugins... can be a very difficult to tame. This
little library as vocation of providing various facilities to handle dynamic
instances and hide a little bit these layers.
